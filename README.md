# Deployment

To deploy a Next.js application to Vercel, start by ensuring your project is configured correctly and all dependencies are installed. Run the build command, typically npm run build, to generate the production-ready files. Next, install the Vercel CLI globally with npm install -g vercel if you haven't already. Then, navigate to your project directory and run vercel login to authenticate your account.

After logging in, run vercel --prod to deploy your application to Vercel's production environment. Vercel will provide you with a unique URL for your deployed application. You can also set up custom domains and environment variables in the Vercel dashboard for further configuration.

Ensure that your Next.js application is configured correctly for production settings, such as setting the NODE_ENV environment variable to production. Test your application thoroughly in the production environment to ensure it functions correctly before making it publicly accessible. Vercel will handle the deployment process and provide you with insights and logs to monitor the deployment progress.
